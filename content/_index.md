# Past Paper 2014-2020

We saw complaints on the official past paper folder on social media. So we decided to release what C Hings have been sharing with us internally to all of QC.

{{<video src="media/past paper.mp4" type="video/mp4" preload=true muted=true autoplay=true loop=true >}}

- Contains past paper from 2014 to 2020 (though some of them are lost to time)
- User-friendly file structure, by form then by subject
- Password protected to ensure only QC members get it (so authority will give us less trouble)

**[Follow this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PYEaXJEfROT08XKLiVl4nqLcF09tsRWT/view?usp=sharing)** for the past paper files.

Password: **favourite colour(s) of dress liked by a *QC teacher*, in order, in English, in lowercase, added together with nothing between.**  
e.g. If favourite colour(s) of dress liked by QC teachers are `black`, `grey`, and `white`, then the password will be `blackgreywhite`.

You can open it with Google Drive's ZIP Extractor if you don't want to download it all at once.
