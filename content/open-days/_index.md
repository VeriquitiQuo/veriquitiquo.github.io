We have words from the school that the *Queen's College Open Days 2022* is cancelled while the student council cabinet [Aqua](https://instagram.com/aquaforqc) hasn't released any statement to students yet.

### Accepting content submissions {.limit-width}

We don't want content for the open days website to go to waste.[^deadline] We'll consider accepting content from clubs or groups. Just submit text and images then we'll transform it into a website for you. We accept `.md` format which allows styling in a WhatsApp / Discord-like way.[^md] We don't want `.pdf` files as they don't provide a good browsing experience.
{.limit-width}

[^deadline]: From when we last heard from Aqua, they requested all content for the open days website to be submitted by 17 June, back when the open days were push to 5-6 August. So content from clubs / societies for the open days website are supposedly completed. (Though that is unlikely since the schedule was unrealistic.)

[^md]: `.md` files are just like `.txt` files but allows easy and flexible formatting that can be converted into websites. You've been using [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/ "markdown guide") if you've styled text in WhatsApp or Discord by surrounding text with `**`.

We'll keep this updated. [Contact us here](https://instagram.com/veriquiti.quo) for submissions or if you have suggestions / comments. We may do it when we have time.
